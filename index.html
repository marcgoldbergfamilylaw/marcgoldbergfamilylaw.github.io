                            <p>
                                I grew up, and have lived in the San Fernando Valley, my entire life. I knew from the
                                time I was 14 years old that I wanted to become an attorney. My 9 th grade history teacher wanted
                                us to learn about the legal system and had us put on a mock trial. I was fortunate enough to be
                                chosen as one of the attorneys. My partner and I won the case. The teacher’s husband, who is an
                                attorney, played the judge. He came to me after the trial and told me that I should think about
                                practicing law as a career, He paid me a very high compliment by telling me “You are a natural”.
                                From that moment on I knew my life’s calling.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I attended California State University, Northridge, where I graduated in 1986 with my
                                Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science and a minor in History. While at CSUN I joined
                                Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity, where I made many lifetime friends and connections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After CSUN, I attended law school at Southwestern University College of Law, in Los
                                Angeles. I graduated from Southwestern in 1990. I passed the California State Bar Examination
                                in 1991 and began practicing law, first in the field of Plaintiff Personal Injury law.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After going through my own divorce, I was encouraged by my attorney to open a Family
                                Law practice. The Law Offices of Marc D. Goldberg has been in operation, serving the needs of
                                family law litigants since 2003. The focus of my law practice, from the very beginning, has been
                                family law. Currently, I have been exclusively practicing Family Law for 17 years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am the father of two daughter, ages 23 and 20, who also now attend CSUN. One is a
                                Child Development major and the other is a Psychology major.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am still as excited by the idea of practicing law and helping people who are going
                                through some of the most stressful times of their lives as I was the day my 9 th grade teacher’s
                                husband first encouraged me to become an attorney. I am a fierce advocate for my clients and
                                always seek, for them, the best possible results that the law allows.

                    <h3>MY PHILOSOPHY OF PRACTING LAW</h3>
                </header>

                <p>
                    I have always had a very strong sense of justice. Whether it was someone being bullied
                    on a playground, or some news article where a person was not treated fairly by a business or the
                    government, my heart has always been with the underdog. As we all do, there were times when I
                    was young, where I felt I had not been treated with fairness and dignity. These ideals set me on a
                    course to ensure that people are treated fairly. I knew that the best way to see these ideals met
                    was in the practice of law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, whether it be a person going through a contentious property battle in a divorce, a
                    parent fighting for the right to spend time with his or her child , or the survivor of domestic
                    violence seeking protection from their abuser, I will take all necessary actions to obtain the best
                    possible result, for my client, that the law provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am strong believer in transparency with my clients to ensure that, not only do they know
                    what legal actions I am taking on behalf, but to thoroughly explain to them why I am taking
                    those actions. You spend a lot of money when you have to retain an attorney to represent your
                    interests in Family Court, and I believe that you should absolutely understand every aspect of the
                    actions being taken to protect your legal rights. I will always be there to answer your questions
                    and to make sure that you are satisfied with the answers you receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I will always handle your case in a timely manner. I do not believe in
                    unnecessarily prolonging a case. I strongly believe in settlement, where possible. But there are
                    times when settlement cannot be reached, and a case must be litigated. My decades of legal
                    knowledge and experience in Court allows me to present your case in the most legally favorable
                    light possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you retain The Law Offices of Marc D. Goldberg to handle your Family Law
                    matter, you can rest assured that you will be treated fairly and with dignity, and you will receive
                    experienced and knowledgeable legal advice and action.
                </p>

                            I met Marc D. Goldberg when I was a single father, struggling in Family Court. I didn’t
                            have legal representation and was trying my level best to self-represent. I had been in Court for
                            three years trying to prove that my child’s mother was drinking and driving and endangering our
                            child’s welfare. I met with and retained Marc. Though I had been in the court system for three
                            years, ringing the alarm bells to this situation, it took Marc less than three months to get me full
                            physical and legal custody. Additionally, he got the Court to issue a monitored visitation order.
                            Later, when my son’s mother violated that order, he was able to have the Court suspend her
                            visitation in its entirety. I believe that Marc single handedly saved my child’s life and future. I
                            will always be indebted to Marc. What he did for my family is immeasurable. His understanding
                            of law, ability to resolve issues with opposing counsel and courtroom savvy cannot be
                            overstated. Anyone who decides to trust him with their legal concerns will not be disappointed.

                            I was very fortunate to be referred to Marc D. Goldberg for my divorce case in the Los
                            Angeles County Superior Court system.
                            While my ex prolonged the case and made it very difficult to navigate, Marc provided
                            expert legal representation. His calm and steady demeanor and his inside knowledge of the
                            system (its people and processes) allowed me, a dad, to win sole legal and physical custody of
                            my 2 older children.
                            Eventually, he helped my current wife formally adopt them after their bio-mother gave up
                            her rights.
                            I wholehearted encourage anyone to contact Marc and allow him to assist you with your
                            family law needs.

                            When I started my divorce, I felt very alone. My husband had threated to take our young
                            daughters back to our home country where women do not have the same rights as they do here. I
                            was referred to Marc D. Goldberg by a dear friend and I am so happy I retained him. He first
                            went to Court and received a restraining order against my husband so that he could not take our
                            daughters out of the United States. He then fought hard for me and I received custody of our
                            daughters. Marc proved beyond any doubt that he is not only extremely professional and
                            extremely knowledgeable in family law, but that he was also extremely empathetic to my
                            situation. Empathy is critical to me, because it showed me that Marc really cares about his clients
                            and that, in turn, creates mutual trust and respect. I am forever grateful to Marc for fighting to
                            ensure that my daughters and I received the best results possible.

                            I had never had to seek legal representation before, in my life, until my children’s father brought
                            a Paternity action against me and sought custody of our two very young children. The experience
                            of finding out that I had to go to Court was intimidating and very stressful. Marc D. Goldberg
                            eased my worries and did an excellent job of representing me. My needs were understood, and I
                            was treated with great respect. My inputs were valued, and my doubts were always allayed. Marc
                            never failed to thoroughly respond to any questions I had, not just with an answer, but with a full
                            explanation of what he was doing and why. He went above and beyond and did everything he
                            could to ensure a successful outcome. I could not have asked for a better attorney.

                            I was a single dad with full physical custody of our daughter. The Paternity case brought against
                            me by my daughter’s mother had gone on since our daughter was a baby. At the time I met Marc
                            D. Goldberg, our daughter was in 6 th grade. When I first met with Marc, I told him that I needed
                            a strong attorney who would protect me, and, most importantly, protect our daughter. From the
                            beginning, Marc’s excellent communication skills, his attention to detail, and his uncanny ability
                            to present my case in Court as if he were me, made me feel that he had a true and vested interest
                            in obtaining the best possible outcome for my daughter and myself. I never felt like I was just
                            another client to him. I would recommend Marc to anyone needing superb legal representation,
                            without reservation.
